# Experience Working on Fingerprint Recognition GUI for Jupyter Notebook

Recently, I was tasked with designing a graphical user interface (GUI) and a template file/database for a fingerprint recognition system, based on the code available in a Jupyter notebook provided by [lovellbrian](https://github.com/lovellbrian/fingerprint). In this blog post, I would like to share my experience, the challenges faced, and the solutions developed during this project.

## Background

Fingerprint recognition is a well-known biometric method used to identify individuals based on their unique fingerprints. Developing a GUI for such a system can significantly improve its usability. The task at hand involved designing a GUI and a template file/database to achieve the following goals:

- Enroll a fingerprint and associate it with a name. Store the template in a file or database.
- Compare a new fingerprint to the fingerprints in the gallery.
- Evaluate the system on a large number of fingerprints and adjust the threshold for good performance with low error rates.
- Produce a ROC curve showing error rates versus the threshold.
- Estimate the false positive rate (false alarm rate) for a false negative rate of 1%.

## Implementation
### GUI
```python
import ipywidgets as widgets
from IPython.display import display
import json
import cv2 as cv
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

# Create GUI elements
name_input = widgets.Text(description="Name:")
fingerprint_file = widgets.FileUpload(description="Upload Fingerprint", accept='*')
enroll_button = widgets.Button(description="Enroll Fingerprint")
message = widgets.HTML()

# Link button click event to function
enroll_button.on_click(enroll_fingerprint)

# Display GUI
display(name_input)
display(widgets.HBox([fingerprint_file, enroll_button]))  # Grouping fingerprint_file and enroll_button horizontally
display(message)
```

### Enrolling a Fingerprint

The first step was to design a GUI that allows users to upload a fingerprint image and associate it with a name. The OpenCV library was used to process the uploaded fingerprint image.

### Comparison, Evaluation, and ROC Curve Generation

The subsequent steps involved comparing the new fingerprint to the ones in the gallery, evaluating the system's performance on a large number of fingerprints, adjusting the threshold for good performance with low error rates, producing an ROC curve, and estimating the false positive rate (false alarm rate) for a false negative rate of 1%. Unfortunately, this part is not yet implemented, but the GUI and the structure for the fingerprint enrollment process are in place.

## Conclusion

Designing a GUI and a template file/database for a fingerprint recognition system in a Jupyter notebook was both challenging and exciting. The process involved dealing with image processing using the OpenCV library, managing files, and developing a user-friendly interface. Although not all the specified parts of the task have been completed yet, the GUI and the structure for the fingerprint enrollment process are in place.
